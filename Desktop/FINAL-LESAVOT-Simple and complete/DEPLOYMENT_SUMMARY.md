# LESAVOT Integration & Deployment Summary

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

All frontend-backend-database integration issues have been resolved and the system is fully functional.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend API Integration
- **Fixed**: Updated `auth.js` to use correct REST API endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/*`)
- **Fixed**: Replaced localStorage-based registration with proper backend API integration
- **Fixed**: Added proper JWT token storage and refresh token handling
- **Fixed**: Updated all authentication endpoints to use environment-aware configuration

### 2. Backend Authentication System
- **Enhanced**: Added `resendOtp` functionality in `authController.js`
- **Enhanced**: Created `findActiveOtpSession` method in `Session.js` model
- **Enhanced**: Improved email configuration with fallback options
- **Enhanced**: Added development mode OTP logging for testing

### 3. Database Connectivity
- **Fixed**: Resolved PostgreSQL connection timeout issues
- **Enhanced**: Increased connection timeouts and added retry logic
- **Enhanced**: Added connection pooling optimization
- **Verified**: Database is fully operational with detailed health monitoring

### 4. CORS & Configuration
- **Fixed**: Updated CORS configuration for proper frontend-backend communication
- **Enhanced**: Created environment-aware frontend configuration
- **Enhanced**: Added proper API endpoint detection for development vs production
