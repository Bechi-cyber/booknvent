                    <h3>3. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA UNDER GDPR</h3>
                    <p>If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), the legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>

                    <p>LESAVOT Advanced Security Systems may process your Personal Data because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We need to perform a contract with you</li>
                        <li>You have given us permission to do so</li>
                        <li>The processing is in our legitimate interests and it is not overridden by your rights</li>
                        <li>To comply with the law</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>4. DATA RETENTION</h3>
                    <p>LESAVOT Advanced Security Systems will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>

                    <p>LESAVOT Advanced Security Systems will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.</p>

                    <h3>5. DATA SECURITY</h3>
                    <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology</li>
                        <li>All data is stored in secure, encrypted databases</li>
                        <li>Access to personal information is restricted to authorized personnel only</li>
                        <li>Regular security assessments and penetration testing</li>
                        <li>Continuous monitoring for unauthorized access attempts</li>
